This directory contains a series of scripts.  The file, sh_grasp2K_ex, 
outlines the steps of a calculation whereas the other scripts show 
how the various applications can be used.  They can be run as 
executables but also show how applications can be run. Input data
is always read in response to prompts.  

It is recommended that users first run the applications interactively, using
the scripts as a manual showing the possible responses to prompts.

Please note that the environment variable GRASP needs to be set in order for the scripts to work.
The environment variable is set by issuing the command

source ./make_environment_gfortran

in the installation directory.
