 There are 69 electrons in the cloud
  in 3 relativistic CSFs
  based on 30 relativistic subshells.

The atomic number is  70.0000000000;
 the mass of the nucleus is  3.115978599513D+05 electron masses;
  Fermi nucleus:
  c = 1.179157016706D-04 Bohr radii,
  a = 9.890591365424D-06 Bohr radii;
  there are 83 tabulation points in the nucleus.

Speed of light =  137.0359990740D+00 atomic units.

Radial grid: R(I) = RNT*(exp((I-1)*H)-1), I = 1, ..., N;

 RNT  =  2.000000000000D-06 Bohr radii;
 H    =  5.000000000000D-02 Bohr radii;
 N    =  590;
 R(1) =  0.000000000000D+00 Bohr radii;
 R(2) =  1.025421927520D-07 Bohr radii;
 R(N) =  1.233111896689D+07 Bohr radii.

 EOL calculation.
 3 levels will be optimised;
  their indices are: 1, 1, 1.
 Each is assigned its statistical weight;
