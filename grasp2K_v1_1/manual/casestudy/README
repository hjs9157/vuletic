Please note that the environment variable GRASP needs to be set in order for the scripts to work.
The environment variable is set by issuing the command (assuming we use the gfortran compiler)

source ./make_environment_gfortran

in the installation directory.

To run the script type

./sh_grasp2K_case

The outpur data should be checked against data in the output directory.
