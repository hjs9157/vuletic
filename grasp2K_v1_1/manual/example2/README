Please note that the environment variable GRASP needs to be set in order for the scripts to work.
The environment variable is set by issuing the command (assuing we are using the gfortran compiler)

source ./make_environment_gfortran

in the installation directory. In addition, nb!, the Hartree-Fock program HF needs to be on the path.

To run the script type

./sh_grasp2K_ex2

The output should be checked against the data in the output2 directory.
